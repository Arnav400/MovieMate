### Appwrite (Optional)
If you plan to use backend features:
1. Install the Appwrite SDK.
2. Configure your Appwrite instance in `src` (e.g., in a config file or service):
```javascript

const client = new Client()
  .setEndpoint('YOUR_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT')
  .setProject('YOUR_PROJECT_ID');
```
3. Update `.env` with Appwrite credentials if needed.

### 1. Set Homepage
Update the `homepage` field in `package.json` to your GitHub Pages URL:
```json
"homepage": "https://yourusername.github.io/MovieMate"
```

### 2. Deploy
```bash
npm run deploy
```
- The app will be built and pushed to the `gh-pages` branch.
- Verify: Visit your GitHub Pages URL (e.g., `https://yourusername.github.io/MovieMate`).

For other hosting platforms, upload the contents of the `dist` folder after running `npm run build`.

## Troubleshooting
- **API Key Issues**: Ensure your TMDB API key is correctly set in `.env` and that it’s not expired.
- **Build Errors**: Run `npm install` again to ensure all dependencies are installed.
- **CORS Errors**: If fetching TMDB data fails, verify your API key and network settings.
- **Deployment Fails**: Check your GitHub Pages settings and ensure the `gh-pages` branch is correctly configured.
